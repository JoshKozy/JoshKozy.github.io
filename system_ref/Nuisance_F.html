  This is MCD (DU) Avionics Fault List display caused by Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NOVRAM) corruption. NOVRAM corruptions do not inhibit normal APDMC operation. The corruption is defined as undesired data in any of the 32,000+ memory locations. The APDMC NOVRAM fault signs are that APM1 or APM2 is active on the Avionics Fault List and will remain after a circuit breaker reset is performed and the IBIT fails. It is permissible to fly the aircraft with this fault message when conditions in the Action Required column are met.</td>

  Verify a NOVRAM corruption has occurred with the following conditions:
  
  1. The affected APDMC is on the Avionics Fault List, APMx.
  
  2. No APDMC WAP message.

  1. Data communication loss. During engine shutdown the PMA de-energizes, thus does not power the EEC. During startup until the PMA is energized, EEC is not powered. EEC data communication to the APDMC is lost during this period causing the APDMC to set this fault.
  
  2. During ground maintenance EEC test, xEEC appears on propulsion fault list or APM-EECx on the non-avionics fault list. Per fault 73-21-RW fault isolation engine run, fault xEEC or APM-EECx does not appear. The cause of this is the EEC is performing ground maintenance checks.
